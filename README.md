## 📘 About This Repo

This repository contains summaries, explanations, and key takeaways from
weekly Holberton assignments.\
The notes are written in a concise, beginner-friendly way but still
include important details for revision.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Why This Exists

Holberton's intranet is detailed --- but sometimes you just need: - A
quick refresher\
- A high-level overview\
- Easy navigation\
- Notes you can read offline

That's exactly what this repo provides.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📁 Structure

Each week has its own folder or markdown file, for example:

    week_0.md
    week_1.md
    week_2/
    ...

Inside each, you'll find clear notes on: - Shell\
- Git\
- C\
- Permissions\
- Networking\
- And more as the program goes on

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🛠 How to Use

-   Open the `.md` files for clean, formatted notes\

-   Use them alongside your projects or for quick revision\
